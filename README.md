# Whiskey Realism

A strategic-AI overhaul mod for **Grand Tactician: The Civil War (1861-1865)** focused on the **Whiskey & Lemons DLC** career mode.

In W&L the player starts at the bottom — commanding an artillery section, regiment, or brigade based on their questionnaire — and serves inside an AI-driven army. That puts a lot of weight on how good the AI playing your nation's Commander-in-Chief and the opposing CIC actually is. Vanilla picks campaign objectives with `Random.Range`. This mod replaces that with a thinking-but-not-historically-deterministic strategic engine for both factions.

## Status

**v0.2.1.1 released. v0.2.2 enrichment is implemented locally and awaiting full in-game runtime smoke/release.**

The mod replaces vanilla's random-objective AI with a personality-driven phased-plan strategic engine for both Confederate and Union AI. Released v0.2.1.1 ships 9 active Harmony patches + sidecar JSON persistence. Local v0.2.2 adds battle-history observers, transfer/front-budget steering, capital-defense steering, weekly CIC strategic review, historical army operating areas, and historical army-group steering using vanilla `ArmyGroup` APIs. 25 hand-coded historical-officer personalities, 12 canonical succession events with concrete `AssignCommando` swaps, 4-stage era progression, two-tier CIC + theater-commander hierarchy, player-CIC noninterference gate, and town/battle war-state observers are in place. Locks the campaign-create menu's Aggressiveness / Historic / Difficulty settings + 5 realism checkboxes to coherent values.

Latest release: [v0.2.1.1](https://github.com/3-Deacon/whiskey-realism-mod/releases/tag/v0.2.1.1) — drop the attached `WhiskeyRealism.dll` into your `<GTCW>/BepInEx/plugins/` folder. Requires BepInEx 5.4.x x64 UnityMono.

## Goals

- **Strategic awareness.** AI commits to phased operational plans and reviews them weekly instead of randomly picking objectives turn by turn.
- **Historical character without scripting.** Era-based doctrine progression (1861 amateur → 1864-65 total war), faction profiles (CSA defensive-aggressive, Union slow-coordinated-pressure), and ~25 hand-coded historical commander personalities (Lee, McClellan, Grant, Sherman, Hood, Johnston, etc.) — composed additively so the same engine produces both Lee's army and Hood's army with the right feel.
- **Recognizable but not deterministic succession.** ~12 canonical historical events (Lee taking ANV command, Grant rising to General-in-Chief, McClellan's removal, Hood replacing Johnston, etc.) gated on date AND war-state. They fire when conditions reasonably hold; if your campaign has gone unusually, alternate histories emerge.
- **W&L-aware.** Player-commanded units are not steamrolled by the AI's strategic decisions — the existing `DLC_WL.dlc_scenarioactive` gate is respected and extended.

## Requirements

1. **Grand Tactician: The Civil War** with the **Whiskey & Lemons DLC**.
2. **BepInEx 5.4.x x64 UnityMono** installed in your game folder.
   - Download: <https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases> → `BepInEx_unitymono_x64_5.4.x`
   - Extract into the game folder so that `<GTCW>/BepInEx/` exists.
   - Run the game once to generate the BepInEx config + plugin folders.

## Install

1. Download the latest `WhiskeyRealism.dll` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/3-Deacon/whiskey-realism-mod/releases).
2. Drop it into `<GTCW>/BepInEx/plugins/`.
3. Launch the game. On first run a config file is generated at `<GTCW>/BepInEx/config/dev.kyle.whiskey-realism.cfg`.

To uninstall: delete `WhiskeyRealism.dll` from `BepInEx/plugins/`. Saves remain compatible with vanilla — mod state is stored in a separate JSON sidecar that vanilla GTCW ignores.

## Compatibility

**Incompatible with the "Community Hotfixes / QoL Mod"** (Steam community) — that mod replaces `Assembly-CSharp.dll` directly while this mod patches the original via Harmony. They cannot coexist. Long-term plan is to fold the Community Hotfix's bug fixes into this mod so users only need one.
